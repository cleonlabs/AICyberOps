I would like you to generate a mock vulnerability report. 
This report should have 50 servers 20 of them running Windows and 30 of them running Linux. 
These servers host databases, web servers and other services. 
This report should have at least 500 vulnerabilities randomly divided amongst the 50 servers. 
The vulnerabilities must be existing and must align with the server's purpose. 
The output should be an excel file.
